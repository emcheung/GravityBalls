# GravityBalls

#Day 1
**Goal:** Create balls that appear to be affected by gravity
* Fork this repository and clone the forked repository. Make sure you're editing the code I've provided, not creating new code
* Cause gravity to affect the single ball provided. Gravity will be _acceleration_ in a particular direction
* Make sure you're remembering to commit _and sync_
* After you have one ball bouncing, create a _branch_ called "CreatingArrays" and remember to _publish_ it
* On this branch, modify your code to have 30 of these gravity balls (or some other number in that range). Once again, remember to commit and sync
* Merge this new branch back in to the master branch
* You're done for the day!


##Acceleration
Just as _velocity_ is change in position over time, _acceleration_ is change in _velocity_ over time. Creating acceleration is going to be very similar to creating velocity. I recommend a variable - perhaps call it "gravity"? I also recommend a small value - perhaps somewhere around .1
